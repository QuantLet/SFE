Description: 'Estimates the DCC model and returns coefficients (coeff) and residuals (eta). Order of the coeffients in vector ''coeff'': omega (1 x dim_ ), alpha (1 x dim_ ), beta (1 x dim_ ), a, b. The first three elements are univariate GARCH parameters, a and b are DCC parameters eta has the same size as X. (Written with MatLab R2007b)'
