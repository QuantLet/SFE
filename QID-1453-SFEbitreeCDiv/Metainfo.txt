Input: 
- i : Interest Rate
- type : 0 is American, 1 is European
- n : Number of Intervals
- k : Exercise Price
- t : Time to Expiration
- s0 : Stock Price
- sig : Volatility
- div : Contionous Dividend in Percentage
- flag : 1 is call, 0 is Put

Output: binomial trees and price of option

Example: 'User inputs parameters [s0, k, i, sig, t, n, type] like [230, 210, 0.04545, 0.25, 0.5, 5 ,0], [option (1 for call, 0 for put), continuous dividend in percentage (0 for no dividend)] as [1, 0.2], then call price is shown.'

Example[Matlab]: 'User inputs the SFEbitreeCDiv parameters [s0, k, i, sig, t, n, type] like[230, 210, 0.04545, 0.25, 0.5, 5 ,0], [option (1 for call, 0 for put), continuous dividend in percentage (0 for no dividend)] as [1, 0.2], then American call price 21.4566 is shown. [s0, k, i, sig, t, n, type] like [1.5, 1.5, 0.09, 0.2, 0.33, 6 ,1], [option (1 for call, 0 for put), continuous dividend in percentage (0 for no dividend)] as [1, 0.02], then American call price 0.0836 is shown.'
