Description: 'Illustrates the (univariate) Central Limit Theorem (CLT). n*1000 sets of n-dimensional Bernoulli samples are generated and used to approximate the distribution of t = sqrt(n)*(mean(x)-mu)/sigma -> N(0,1). The estimated density (red) of t is shown together with the standard normal (green).'
