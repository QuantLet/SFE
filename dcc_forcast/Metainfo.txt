Description: 'Makes one-step-ahead forecast and simulation according to the DCC model. 
Output is: H_f is the forecast of the matrix H at t+1, Ret_f is H_f multiplied with e_t, random standard normal vector, hence Ret_f is the simulated values of X at t+1 H_f has the size (dim_ x dim_) Ret_f has the size (dim_ x 1). Written in MatLab R2007b.'

Keywords:  simulation, forecast, garch, multivariate, time-series
